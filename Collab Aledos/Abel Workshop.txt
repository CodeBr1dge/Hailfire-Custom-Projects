# Brad Notes

If an Entity has/is [Attribute_Condition] give the Entity a [Tag_Score] of [###]
If an Entity's [Total_Tag_Score] passes that tag's [Minimum_Requirement] assign the [Tag] 
The [Tag_Score] for each Entity is based on the results of the total [Tag_Weights] and the [Attribute_Elements] 


Scaling as tag doesn't mean what you are it is 
The Orientation tags are all 










Abel Notes

Scaling tag- I want to give players something actionable to plan their gameplay around based off of who scales well and who doesn't.

If the entity does the same type of damage that it scales from, then its easier to itemize to penetrate that kind of defense which would mean a higher offence tag rating.
